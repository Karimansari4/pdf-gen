<h1 align="center">PDF uploading and exporting MERN App</h1> <br/><br/>

# Fullstack developer task

## Task Description:
You are tasked to develop a web application that allows users to upload a PDF file and extract certain pages from the PDF to create a new PDF. The user should be able to select which pages they want to include in the new PDF.

## Frontend (Any React framework):
- Implement a simple form to upload a PDF file. The form should include validation to ensure that only PDF files are uploaded.
- Once the file is uploaded, display a visual representation of all pages in the PDF.
- Allow users to select which pages they want to extract from the original PDF. This can be achieved through checkboxes or a similar UI element associated with each page.
- Include a button or functionality to create the new PDF based on the selected pages. Once completed, offer a download link to the user for the newly created PDF.
- All pages should be responsive and should work from mobile devices.

## Backend (Any Node.js framework):
- Create a REST API to handle the upload of the PDF file and store it on the server.
- Create a REST API to retrieve the stored PDF file for display.
- Implement a REST API to extract the selected pages from the original PDF and create a new PDF. You can use any PDF library to achieve this in the Node.js framework you use.
- Ensure all APIs work correctly and handle potential errors.

## Bonus:
- Add frontend and backend tests.
- Add a live hosted version of the app
- Implement user authentication so that each user can have their own set of PDF files.
- Allow the user to rearrange the order of selected pages in the new PDF.
